      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on
        Currency’s website, iOS app, or Android app.
      </p>

      <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>
        We do <b>not</b> collect personal information such as your name, email
        address, phone number, or location. Our server may store basic technical
        information, such as your IP address.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of your app settings are stored on your device — they are
        <b>not</b> stored on our servers. If you are on an iOS device, this
        information may also be stored in iCloud so that the data syncs to your
        other iOS devices.
      </p>

      <h4>Ads and Analytics</h4>
      <p>
        Our app may collect aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the number
        of times the app is launched, to improve the app and for internal
        reporting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our app is integrated with Google’s AdMob and Analytics, which allows us
        to serve advertisements within the app. Google may collect and use
        personal data, including your device’s advertising ID, for the purposes
        of serving advertisements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our app is integrated with Google’s Firebase and Crashlytics. This
        allows us to monitor the health of the app and be aware of potential
        problems that we may wish to fix, such as crashes. This also provides us
        with analytics and reporting in aggregate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our iOS app is integrated with RevenueCat to manage the in-app purchase
        functionality of the app. If you make an in-app purchase, RevenueCat
        will receive a receipt containing information about that purchase.
        RevenueCat does <b>not</b> receive or process your payment information,
        such as a credit card number.
      </p>
      <p>
