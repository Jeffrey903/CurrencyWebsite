        United States of America. We make no representation that the content in
        the App or the App are appropriate or available for use in other
        locations, and access to them from territories where their content or
        use is illegal is prohibited. Those who choose to access this App from

        are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws. You may not
        use or export the content in violation of U.S. export laws and
        regulations. Any action related to the App, the content or the Terms
        shall be governed by New York law and controlling U.S. federal law,
        without regard to conflicts of laws thereof. You hereby consent and
        submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal

      </p>

      <h3>BINDING ARBITRATION</h3>
      <p>
        In the event of a dispute arising under or relating to the Terms or the
        App (each, a “Dispute”), either party may elect to finally and
        exclusively resolve the dispute by binding arbitration governed by the
        Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”). Any election to arbitrate, at any time,
        shall be final and binding on the other party. IF EITHER PARTY CHOOSES
        ARBITRATION, NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM
        IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS
        CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS
        COURT’S RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS
        DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE
        LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved before a neutral
        arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be
        final, except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. The
        arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its
        then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in
        accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where
        appropriate, pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
        Procedures. All applicable JAMS’ rules and procedures are available at
        the JAMS website www.jamsadr.com. Each party will be responsible for
        paying any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in
        accordance with JAMS rules. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be
        entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude
        parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a
        court of appropriate jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in
        person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If
        conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United
        States county where you reside. The parties may litigate in court to
        compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to
        confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the
        arbitrator. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary
        and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other
        information (including electronically stored information) relevant to
        the Dispute immediately after commencement of the arbitration.
      </p>

      <h3>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h3>
      <p>
        You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the
        Dispute between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by
        law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other;
        (ii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated or
        resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures;
        and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought
        in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public
        or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US
        ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER
        IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
      </p>

      <h3>MISCELLANEOUS</h3>
      <p>
        You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency
        relationship exists between you and Currency App LLC as a result of the
        Terms or your use of the App. The Terms constitute the entire agreement
        between you and Currency App LLC with respect to your use of the App.
        The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the
        Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any
        provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to
        be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should
        endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the
        provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force
        and effect. You may not assign, delegate or otherwise transfer your
        account or your obligations under these Terms without the prior written
        consent of us. We have the right, in its sole discretion, to transfer or
        assign all or any part of its rights under these Terms and will have the
        right to delegate or use third party contractors to fulfill its duties
        and obligations under these Terms and in connection with the App. Our
        notice to you via email, regular mail or notices or links on the App
        shall constitute acceptable notice to you under the Terms. A printed
        version of the Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be
        admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or
        relating to the Terms to the same extent and subject to the same
        conditions as other business documents and records originally generated
        and maintained in printed form. Section titles and headings in the Terms
        are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Any
        rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.
